# Static Site Hosting for Simple Systems
This repo is a collection of static sites hosted by [Simple Systems, LLC](https://simplesystems.tech/). Sites are deployed as a [DigitalOcean App](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform) with multiple static sites.

Mirrored from Gitea

Currently, DigitalOcean only supports deploying Apps from GitHub or GitLab repos. An [idea](https://ideas.digitalocean.com/app-platform/p/allow-static-site-deployment-from-other-cms) is in progress to support something like Gitea.

Until other git platforms are supported, this repo will be mirrored to [GitHub](https://github.com/simple-systems-se/static-sites).

Repo Structure
--
Each directory is mapped to a deployed site (Ex: test.northid.health). The directory name matches the domain used in the static site config.
